/**
 A mutable dictionary class.
 
 A CFMutableDictionaryRef is used internally to store the key-value pairs. Subclasses may choose to add other instance variables to enable a specific ordering of keys, override methods to modify behavior, and add methods to extend existing behaviors. However, all subclasses should behave like a standard Cocoa dictionary as much as possible, and document clearly when they do not.
 
 @note Any method inherited from NSDictionary or NSMutableDictionary is supported by this class and its children. Please see the documentation for those classes for details.
 
 @todo Implement @c -copy and @c -mutableCopy differently (so users can actually obtain an immutable copy) and make mutation methods aware of immutability?
